The goal of LCMSQA is to make it easy to check the quality of LC/MS experiments
using a Shiny application. This package provides interactive data visualizations
for quality control (QC) samples, including total ion current chromatogram
(TIC), base peak chromatogram (BPC), mass spectrum, extracted ion chromatogram
(XIC), and feature detection results from internal standards or known
metabolites.

To install this package,

``` r
install.packages("LCMSQA")
```
